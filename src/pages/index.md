    title: PID Tuning
    subtitle: A modern approach via the Weighted Sensitivity Problem
    content: >
      This is a book on PID tuning with emphasis on analytical procedures. The
      main objective is to show how robustness, performance, and
      servo/regulation requirements translate into the tuning expressions. As
      for the Weighted Sensitivity Problem formulation, we the authors have
      found that it serves the main purpose very well, allowing us to blend
      ideas from H∞ and IMC theories. So, the book can also serve as an
      introduction to these more advanced topics.

        content: "The PID controller is the most common option in the realm of control applications and is dominant in the process control industry. Among the related analytical methods, Internal Model Control (IMC) has gained remarkable industrial acceptance due to its robust nature and good set-point responses. However, the traditional application of IMC results in poor load disturbance rejection for lag-dominant and integrating plants. This book presents an IMC-like design method which avoids this common pitfall and is devised to work well for plants of modest complexity, for which analytical PID tuning is plausible. For simplicity, the design only focuses on the closed-loop sensitivity function, including formulations for the H∞\_and H2\_norms. Aimed at graduate students and researchers in control engineering, this book:\n\n*   Considers both the robustness/performance and the servo/regulation trade-offs\n*   Presents a systematic, optimization-based approach, ultimately leading to well-motivated, model-based, and analytically derived tuning rules\n*   Shows how to tune PID controllers in a unified way, encompassing stable, integrating, and unstable processes\n*   Finds in the Weighted Sensitivity Problem the sweet spot of robust, optimal, and PID control\n*   Provides a common analytical framework that generalizes existing tuning proposals\n"

          “The analytical method proposed by the book yields good performance,
          is motivated by a rigorous framework, and simplifies the design
          process as much as possible. This is the concern of engineers.”

          ### Introduction


          The book starts with a bird's-eye view of the contents. This chapter
          serves as a summary of the main ideas within the chapters to come.
          Although the book has been laid out to be read linearly, this elevated
          view will help you decide the exact route you want to follow,
          depending on your background and interests.

          ### Simple model-matching approach to robust PID design


          A servo-oriented design is presented under the light of the simplest
          Model Matching Problem. The resulting PID tuning rules are very
          similar to the Lambda Tuning ones.
      - content: >
          ### Alternative design for load disturbance improvement


          In the previous chapter, we obtained tuning rules aimed at good
          set-point responses. However, as it happens with traditional IMC-based
          tuning rules, the response to load disturbances can be sluggish. This
          chapter proposes a modified Model Matching Problem which is better for
          regulatory purposes. A new parameter, Gamma, is introduced.
      - content: >
          ### Analysis of the smooth/tight-servo/regulation tuning approaches


          It makes sense to compare the two approaches seen so far. The first
          one, as in traditional IMC, is referred to as Lambda Tuning, while the
          second one is called Gamma Tuning. This chapter explores the limits of
          each approach.
      - content: >
          ### H∞ design with application to PI tuning


          Based on the accumulated know-how, this chapter proposes a new design
          which combines the strenghts of both the Lambda and Gamma Tuning
          approaches. The formulation relies on the H∞, or supremum, norm. For
          simplicity, the discussion considers the application to PI tuning
          only, leaving the more general PID case for later.
      - content: >
          ### Generalized IMC design and H2 approach


          The IMC design philosophy, sometimes called Lambda Tuning in the PID
          context, is very popular within the control community. How does the
          proposed method compare to conventional IMC? In particular, this
          chapter presents an interpretation of the proposed sensitivity weight
          in terms of IMC filters. To make the analogy closer, the design is
          reformulated using the H2 norm.
      - content: >
          ### PID design as a Weighted Sensitivity Problem


          This chapter retakes the H∞ design to consider the full PID case.
          Tuning rules are given for the most typical first and second order
          models found in practice.
      - content: >
          ### PID tuning guidelines for balanced operation


          Finally, how to tune the two knobs at hand, namely Lambda and Gamma,
          in order to obtain a *balanced* closed-loop? This is the question
          tackled in this final chapter.

          **Marketing in the real world** is very different than what we learn
          at school. If you've recently graduated and are making your first
          steps in the business, it's imperative that you know how to use the
          tools and tricks of the trade.

          > **The world of marketing has changed dramatically in the last 10
          > years. Those who understand it, will succeed. But those who stay
          > behind, will have a lot to catch up on.”**

          In this book I will teach you everything I know about B2B marketing.
          From branding, marketing planning, content creation, SEO and PPC, to
          segmenting your audience and understanding today's metrics and
          analytics methodologies — this guide is the only marketing education
          you'll ever need.
